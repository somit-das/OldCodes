In Java, when the JVM creates an object of a class, it initializes the instance variables (fields) with default values. This automatic assignment of default values can be considered analogous to "dependency injection" in the sense that the JVM injects values into the fields of an object.

However, **dependency injection (DI)** typically refers to a design pattern used to provide dependencies to objects from an external source (like a framework), rather than the JVM's default initialization process.

### Default Initialization in Java

When an object is created, the following default values are assigned to its instance variables:
- **Numeric types**: `0` for `int`, `long`, `short`, `byte`
- **Floating-point types**: `0.0` for `float` and `double`
- **Boolean**: `false`
- **Object references**: `null`
- **Characters**: `'\u0000'` (the null character)

### Example: Default Values in a Java Class

```java
public class MyClass {
    int number;
    boolean flag;
    String name;

    public void printDefaults() {
        System.out.println("Default int: " + number);     // 0
        System.out.println("Default boolean: " + flag);   // false
        System.out.println("Default String: " + name);    // null
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        obj.printDefaults();
    }
}
```

### Dependency Injection (DI)

Dependency Injection, in contrast, involves passing dependencies (such as objects or services) from an external source at runtime. It's often used in frameworks like Spring to manage object creation and wiring.

In DI:
1. **Constructor Injection**: Dependencies are provided through the constructor.
2. **Setter Injection**: Dependencies are provided through setters.
3. **Field Injection**: Dependencies are injected directly into fields (though less common in practice due to potential issues).

### Example of Dependency Injection (Constructor Injection)

```java
public class MyService {
    private final DatabaseConnection dbConnection;

    // Constructor injection
    public MyService(DatabaseConnection dbConnection) {
        this.dbConnection = dbConnection;
    }

    public void performService() {
        dbConnection.connect();
        System.out.println("Service performed using dependency.");
    }
}

public class DatabaseConnection {
    public void connect() {
        System.out.println("Connected to database.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DatabaseConnection dbConnection = new DatabaseConnection();
        MyService service = new MyService(dbConnection);  // Dependency injected here
        service.performService();
    }
}
```

### Key Differences Between JVM Initialization and Dependency Injection
- **Default Initialization**: JVM assigns default values (0, `false`, `null`, etc.) to fields when an object is created.
- **Dependency Injection**: Explicitly provides objects or services that an object depends on, either through constructors, setters, or fields.

While JVM default initialization sets fields to basic values, DI is about providing more complex objects or configurations. The term "injection" in DI generally refers to passing external dependencies to make an object work, rather than the automatic assignment of default values by the JVM.
