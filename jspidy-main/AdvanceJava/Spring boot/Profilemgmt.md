# if i set active profile on necessary class for only production , but i need them also for development is code will break as i am only working on development

If you set an active profile (e.g., "production") for a class or bean and want that class to be available in both production and development, your code **will not break**, but the class or bean may not be loaded when you're in the "development" profile unless you configure it correctly. Here's how you can handle this scenario to ensure that the class or bean works for both environments (production and development).

### The Problem

If you annotate a class or bean with `@Profile("production")`, that class will only be loaded when the **production** profile is active. If you are currently working in the **development** profile, the bean will not be available in the application context, and this can lead to issues such as `NoSuchBeanDefinitionException`.

### Example of the Issue

Let's say you have a service class that is configured to run only in the **production** profile:

```java
@Profile("production")
@Service
public class MyService {
    public void runProductionTask() {
        System.out.println("Running production task");
    }
}
```

If you are working in the **development** profile, this service will not be available, and if something in your application tries to use `MyService`, you will get an error like this:

```bash
NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No qualifying bean of type 'MyService' available
```

### The Solution: Multi-Profile Configuration

You can configure the class or bean to be available in **both** the **development** and **production** profiles by specifying multiple profiles in the `@Profile` annotation. This way, the class or bean will be active if either of those profiles is selected.

### Step 1: Configure Multiple Profiles

You can make your class or bean available for multiple profiles by passing an array of profiles to the `@Profile` annotation:

```java
@Profile({"production", "development"})
@Service
public class MyService {
    public void runTask() {
        System.out.println("Running task for both development and production");
    }
}
```

In this case, the `MyService` bean will be loaded whether you have the `production` or `development` profile active. This ensures that your code works in both environments without any issues.

### Step 2: Set Active Profiles in `application.properties`

To ensure your application knows which profile to use, you can specify the active profile in your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file.

#### Example 1: Development Profile

For development, you would typically set the active profile as `development`:

```properties
# application.properties
spring.profiles.active=development
```

#### Example 2: Production Profile

For production, you can set the active profile as `production`:

```properties
# application.properties
spring.profiles.active=production
```

By setting the active profile in this way, you control which beans are loaded based on the environment you're working in.

### Step 3: Use `@Profile("!profile")` for Exclusion

If you want a bean to be active in all profiles **except** for a specific one (e.g., active in all profiles except production), you can use the negation operator (`!`) in the `@Profile` annotation:

```java
@Profile("!production")
@Service
public class MyDevelopmentService {
    public void runDevelopmentTask() {
        System.out.println("Running task for all environments except production");
    }
}
```

This bean will be available in any environment except for **production**.

### Step 4: Using Default Profile (Optional)

You can also create a bean without any `@Profile` annotation. This bean will be active in all environments unless specific profiles override its behavior.

```java
@Service
public class DefaultService {
    public void runDefaultTask() {
        System.out.println("Running in all environments unless overridden");
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

- **`@Profile`** is used to conditionally load beans based on the active profile.
- If you need a class or bean to work in multiple profiles (e.g., both production and development), you can list multiple profiles in the `@Profile` annotation like this: `@Profile({"production", "development"})`.
- Set the active profile in your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file to ensure that the correct profile is being used.
- You can use `@Profile("!profile")` to exclude beans from specific profiles.
  
By following this approach, you ensure that your application behaves correctly in both development and production environments, without breaking during development.
