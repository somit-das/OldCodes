# When to Use @Configuration & @Component

In Spring, both `@Configuration` and `@Component` are annotations used to define beans and manage dependencies, but they serve different purposes. Here’s a detailed comparison of when to use each annotation:

### `@Configuration`

1. **Purpose**: 
   - The `@Configuration` annotation is used to indicate that a class declares one or more `@Bean` methods. It is a source of bean definitions.

2. **Use Case**:
   - Use `@Configuration` when you need to create and configure Spring beans explicitly. This is particularly useful when you need to provide additional configuration, such as specifying constructor arguments or configuring complex beans.

3. **Example**:
   ```java
   @Configuration
   public class AppConfig {

       @Bean
       public MyService myService() {
           return new MyService();
       }

       @Bean
       public MyRepository myRepository() {
           return new MyRepository(myService());
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Features**:
   - Classes annotated with `@Configuration` can contain methods annotated with `@Bean` to define beans.
   - `@Configuration` classes are processed by Spring to ensure that their beans are created in a single instance (singleton scope by default).
   - It can also support method injection and dependency resolution.

### `@Component`

1. **Purpose**:
   - The `@Component` annotation indicates that a class is a Spring-managed component. It is a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed bean.

2. **Use Case**:
   - Use `@Component` for classes that are service, repository, or any other class that doesn’t require custom configuration or that can be automatically discovered through component scanning.

3. **Example**:
   ```java
   @Component
   public class MyService {
       // Service methods here
   }
   ```

4. **Features**:
   - Spring scans classes annotated with `@Component` and registers them as beans in the Spring application context.
   - It simplifies the configuration by allowing Spring to automatically discover components without the need for explicit configuration in a `@Configuration` class.

### Key Differences

| Feature                | `@Configuration`                         | `@Component`                     |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Purpose                | Defines beans explicitly                 | Marks a class as a Spring-managed component |
| Usage                  | For creating and configuring beans      | For simple components that need to be auto-discovered |
| Bean Definition        | Contains `@Bean` methods                 | Each class annotated is considered a bean |
| Scope Control          | Supports method-level scope control     | Single-instance beans by default (can use `@Scope`) |
| Proxying               | CGLIB proxying by default (for method calls) | CGLIB proxying if needed based on context (AOP) |

### When to Use Each

- **Use `@Configuration` When**:
  - You need to create complex beans with specific configurations.
  - You want to control the lifecycle of the beans, such as specifying scope, initialization, or destruction callbacks.
  - You need to define multiple related beans that share a common configuration.

- **Use `@Component` When**:
  - You want Spring to automatically detect and register a class as a bean.
  - Your class is a simple service, repository, or utility that does not need additional configuration.
  - You prefer convention over configuration, allowing Spring to manage most of the setup.

### Conclusion

In summary, use `@Configuration` when you need explicit control over bean creation and configuration, and use `@Component` when you want to let Spring automatically discover and manage simpler components. This separation helps keep your application organized and maintains a clear structure between configuration and business logic.
