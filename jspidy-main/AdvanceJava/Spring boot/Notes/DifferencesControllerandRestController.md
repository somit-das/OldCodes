# difference between controller and rest controller

In Spring Framework (a popular Java framework for building web applications), both `@Controller` and `@RestController` are used to handle HTTP requests, but they serve different purposes and behave slightly differently. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### 1. **`@Controller`**

- **Purpose**: It's used for handling web requests and is often used in combination with view templates like JSP, Thymeleaf, etc. It is part of the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture.
  
- **View Rendering**: When a controller method returns a value (usually a String), Spring treats this value as the name of the view (e.g., JSP, Thymeleaf) that will be rendered.

- **Typical Use Case**: When you're building a web application where you need to return HTML, you would use `@Controller`.

- **Example**:
    ```java
    @Controller
    public class HomeController {

        @GetMapping("/home")
        public String homePage(Model model) {
            model.addAttribute("message", "Welcome to the home page!");
            return "home";  // This refers to 'home.html' or 'home.jsp'
        }
    }
    ```
    In this example, the method `homePage()` returns a String (`"home"`), which tells Spring to look for a view named `home.jsp` or `home.html` in your template directory.

### 2. **`@RestController`**

- **Purpose**: It's a specialized version of `@Controller`, typically used in RESTful web services where you want to return **data** (usually in JSON or XML format) directly as the response body.
  
- **No View Rendering**: Unlike `@Controller`, when a method in a `@RestController` returns an object, Spring automatically serializes the object into a format like JSON or XML and sends it in the HTTP response body.

- **Implicit `@ResponseBody`**: The key difference is that `@RestController` is annotated with `@ResponseBody`, meaning it will automatically serialize the returned data and send it as the HTTP response body. You don't need to explicitly annotate methods with `@ResponseBody`.

- **Typical Use Case**: When you're building a REST API, you use `@RestController` because you usually need to return data instead of a view.

- **Example**:
    ```java
    @RestController
    public class ApiController {

        @GetMapping("/api/data")
        public Map<String, String> getData() {
            Map<String, String> data = new HashMap<>();
            data.put("message", "This is JSON data");
            return data;  // Automatically converted to JSON {"message":"This is JSON data"}
        }
    }
    ```
    In this example, the method `getData()` returns a `Map<String, String>`, which Spring will automatically convert into JSON.

### Key Differences

| Aspect                | `@Controller`                      | `@RestController`                             |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Purpose**    | Handles web pages and views        | Handles RESTful APIs, returns data (JSON/XML) |
| **View Rendering**     | Returns a view (e.g., JSP, HTML)   | Returns data directly (e.g., JSON, XML)       |
| **Annotation**         | Needs to be combined with `@ResponseBody` if returning data | Implicitly includes `@ResponseBody`           |
| **Typical Use**        | MVC applications                   | RESTful web services                          |

### When to Use:

- Use `@Controller` when you are working with traditional **server-side rendered web applications** where you need to render HTML views.
  
- Use `@RestController` when you're building **REST APIs** and want to return data (JSON/XML) instead of rendering a view.

### Example of Combined Use:

In a real-world application, you might use both depending on the specific requirement. You could use `@Controller` for serving HTML pages and `@RestController` for providing API endpoints.
