# MapsId vs EmbeddedId

`@EmbeddedId` and `@MapsId` are both used in JPA (Java Persistence API) to handle composite keys and shared primary keys, respectively, but they serve different purposes. Let’s break down each one, their use cases, and their differences.

## 1. **@EmbeddedId**
`@EmbeddedId` is used for **composite primary keys**, where a primary key is made up of **multiple columns**. It allows you to embed a primary key class that represents the composite key inside the entity.

### When to use `@EmbeddedId`:
- When an entity has a **composite key** (i.e., a primary key made up of multiple fields).
- If you want to encapsulate these multiple fields in a separate class, making the entity's primary key more reusable and cleaner.

### Example of `@EmbeddedId`:

#### Step 1: Define the Embeddable Composite Key Class

This class contains the fields that make up the composite key. It is marked with `@Embeddable`.

```java
import java.io.Serializable;
import javax.persistence.Embeddable;

@Embeddable
public class OrderId implements Serializable {
    private Long customerId;
    private Long productId;

    // Constructors, getters, setters, hashCode(), and equals() methods
}
```

#### Step 2: Use the `@EmbeddedId` in the Entity

You embed the `OrderId` into the entity using `@EmbeddedId`.

```java
import javax.persistence.*;

@Entity
public class Order {

    @EmbeddedId
    private OrderId id;  // Composite key
    
    private Integer quantity;

    // Other fields, getters, setters, etc.
}
```

### Database Table Representation

If your table is for an **Order**, it might look like this:

| customer_id | product_id | quantity |
|-------------|------------|----------|
| 101         | 501        | 3        |
| 102         | 502        | 2        |

In this case, the composite key is made up of `customer_id` and `product_id`.

### Benefits of `@EmbeddedId`:
- **Encapsulation of Keys**: The composite key logic is encapsulated in a separate class, making the main entity class cleaner.
- **Reusability**: The embeddable class can be reused in multiple entities if needed.
- **Cleaner Design**: It provides a clean and modular way to represent composite keys in the code.

### Drawbacks:
- Complex key management compared to single-field primary keys.
- Handling large composite keys can make querying slower and more difficult to manage.


## 2. **@MapsId**
`@MapsId` is used when two entities share the same primary key in a **one-to-one** relationship. Instead of defining a new primary key for the child entity, you map its primary key to the foreign key of another entity (the parent). The foreign key in the child entity acts as its primary key.

### When to use `@MapsId`:
- When two entities have a **shared primary key**.
- The child entity’s primary key is a foreign key that references the parent entity's primary key.
- To enforce a **one-to-one relationship** where the child entity cannot exist without the parent entity.

### Example of `@MapsId`:

#### Step 1: Define the Parent Entity (`User`):

```java
import javax.persistence.*;

@Entity
public class User {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String name;
    
    // Getters and Setters
}
```

#### Step 2: Define the Child Entity (`FacultyProfile`), Sharing the ID with the Parent:

```java
import javax.persistence.*;

@Entity
public class FacultyProfile {

    @Id
    private Long id;  // This is the same as the User's ID

    @OneToOne
    @MapsId  // Reuses the ID of the User
    @JoinColumn(name = "user_id")
    private User user;

    private String department;
    
    // Getters and Setters
}
```

### Benefits of `@MapsId`:
- **Enforces Referential Integrity**: The child entity cannot exist without the parent entity, as they share the same primary key.
- **Simplified Data Model**: Instead of having redundant primary keys, the foreign key also acts as the primary key.
- **Clean One-to-One Relationships**: Ideal for situations where you want to maintain strict one-to-one mappings between two tables/entities.

### Drawbacks:
- Works only for **one-to-one** relationships.
- The child entity depends heavily on the parent entity, meaning it can’t exist independently.

### Database Table Representation

For the above example, if you have `User` and `FacultyProfile` entities, the `FacultyProfile` table might look like this:

| id  | user_id | department         |
|-----|---------|--------------------|
| 1   | 1       | Computer Science   |
| 2   | 2       | Mathematics        |

Here, `user_id` is both the primary key and a foreign key referencing the `User` table.

## 3. **Key Differences: @EmbeddedId vs @MapsId**

| Feature             | **@EmbeddedId**                               | **@MapsId**                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**          | Used for composite primary keys.              | Used for shared primary keys in a one-to-one relationship. |
| **Key Structure**    | Composite key made up of multiple columns.    | Single key, which is also a foreign key from the parent entity. |
| **Entity Relationship** | Works with any relationship type (one-to-many, many-to-one). | Primarily for one-to-one relationships.      |
| **Primary Key**      | Defined inside an embeddable class.           | Shared with the parent entity.               |
| **Complexity**       | More complex because of multiple key fields.  | Simpler, as it uses the parent's key.        |
| **Example Use Case** | An `Order` entity with a composite key (customer + product). | A `FacultyProfile` that shares its ID with `User`. |

### When to Use:
- Use `**@EmbeddedId**` when you need to represent composite keys (multiple fields acting as a primary key).
- Use `**@MapsId**` when you need to **share a primary key** between two entities, typically in a **one-to-one** relationship.
