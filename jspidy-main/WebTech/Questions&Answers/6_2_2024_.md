### 17. What is HTML?
A->
<ol type="a">

<li>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used for creating and structuring the content of web pages on the World Wide Web. It provides a set of elements, tags, and attributes that define the structure, layout, and presentation of text, images, links, multimedia, and other content within a web page.

Here are some key points about HTML:

1. **Markup Language**: HTML is a markup language, meaning it uses tags and attributes to define the structure and semantics of content within a web page. HTML tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and typically come in pairs, with an opening tag ('<tag>') and a closing tag ('</tag>'), surrounding the content.

2. **Document Structure**: HTML documents consist of nested elements arranged in a hierarchical structure. The top-level element is the '<html>' element, which contains the entire document. Within the '<html>' element, there are '<head>' and '<body>' elements, representing the head and body sections of the document, respectively.

3. **Elements and Tags**: HTML elements represent different types of content, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, forms, images, links, and more. Each element is defined by an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Some elements are self-closing, meaning they don't have a separate closing tag and are written as '<tag />'.

4. **Attributes**: HTML elements can have attributes, which provide additional information or properties about the element. Attributes are specified within the opening tag and consist of a name and a value. Common attributes include "id", "class", "src", "href", "alt", "style", and "title", among others.

5. **Semantic Markup**: HTML5 introduced semantic elements that provide more meaningful and descriptive tags for defining the structure and content of web pages. Examples of semantic elements include '<header>', '<nav>','<main>',' <section>', '<article>', '<aside>', '<footer>', and '<figure>', which help improve accessibility, SEO, and maintainability of web pages.

6. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: HTML is supported by all modern web browsers, ensuring that web pages created with HTML are rendered consistently across different browsers and platforms.

7. **Responsive Web Design**: HTML, in combination with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript, enables developers to create responsive web designs that adapt and optimize the layout and appearance of web pages based on the size, orientation, and capabilities of the user's device, such as desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

In summary, HTML is the fundamental building block of web pages, providing the structure and content markup necessary for creating and presenting information on the World Wide Web. It is widely used by web developers to design and build websites, web applications, and digital content accessible through web browsers.</li>
<li>HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the World Wide Web. It provides a set of markup tags or elements that define the structure, layout, and presentation of web pages and documents.

Here are some key points about HTML:

1. **Markup Language**: HTML is a markup language, meaning it uses tags or elements to mark up and define different parts of a document. These elements indicate the structure and semantics of the content, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, tables, forms, and more.

2. **Structure of HTML Document**: An HTML document consists of nested elements organized in a hierarchical structure. It typically begins with a document type declaration (`<!DOCTYPE html>`) followed by an HTML element (`<html>`) that contains the entire document. The document is divided into two main sections: the head section (`<head>`) for metadata and the body section (`<body>`) for the visible content.

3. **Tags and Elements**: HTML tags are enclosed in angle brackets (`<` and `>`), and most come in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag (e.g., `<p>` and `</p>` for paragraphs). Some tags, such as `<img>` for images or `<br>` for line breaks, are self-closing and do not require a separate closing tag.

4. **Attributes**: HTML elements can have attributes that provide additional information or modify the behavior of the element. Attributes are specified within the opening tag and consist of a name and a value (e.g., `href="https://www.example.com"` for a hyperlink).

5. **Browser Rendering**: Web browsers interpret HTML documents and render them into visual web pages that users can view and interact with. Browsers parse the HTML code, apply styles using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and execute JavaScript code to create interactive features and dynamic behavior.

6. **Evolution of HTML**: HTML has evolved over time through different versions, with HTML5 being the latest major revision. HTML5 introduced new features and elements to support modern web development practices, multimedia content, and mobile devices.

7. **Semantic HTML**: Semantic HTML refers to the practice of using HTML elements that convey the meaning and structure of the content, rather than relying solely on presentation or styling. Semantic HTML enhances accessibility, search engine optimization (SEO), and the overall understanding of web documents by both humans and machines.

In summary, HTML is the fundamental language of the World Wide Web used to create structured documents and web pages. It defines the layout, content, and presentation of web pages and serves as the building blocks for creating interactive and accessible web experiences.</li>

In summary, a markup language is a system for annotating documents with tags or codes that define the structure, formatting, and semantics of the content. It provides a standardized way to represent and process information in a machine-readable format, enabling interoperability and rendering across different software applications and platforms.</li>
<li>A markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text. Markup languages are used to describe the structure and formatting of documents, enabling the separation of content from presentation. They allow users to define elements, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more, using tags or markers embedded within the text.

Here are some key points about markup languages:

1. **Syntax**: Markup languages use special characters or symbols, called markup tags or elements, to indicate the structure and formatting of the document. These tags are typically enclosed in angle brackets (`<` and `>`), and most come in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag (e.g., `<p>` and `</p>` for paragraphs).

2. **Hierarchy**: Markup languages organize elements hierarchically, with nested elements contained within parent elements. This hierarchical structure defines the relationships between different parts of the document and allows for complex compositions of content.

3. **Attributes**: Markup elements can have attributes, which provide additional information or modify the behavior of the element. Attributes are specified within the opening tag and consist of a name and a value (e.g., `href="https://www.example.com"` for a hyperlink).

4. **Examples**: Some commonly used markup languages include:
   - **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**: Used to create and structure web pages and documents on the World Wide Web.
   - **XML (eXtensible Markup Language)**: A flexible markup language used for representing and exchanging structured data between different systems and platforms.

### 19. Differentiate between Markup-Language vs text?

A->
<ol type="a">
<li>Markup language and plain text are two different ways of representing information in digital documents, and they serve distinct purposes:

1. **Markup Language**:
   - **Definition**: A markup language is a system for annotating a document with tags or markers that define its structure, formatting, and semantic meaning.
   - **Purpose**: Markup languages are used to describe the structure and presentation of documents, enabling the separation of content from presentation. They allow users to specify elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more using markup tags.
   - **Examples**: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a commonly used markup language for creating and structuring web pages on the World Wide Web. XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is another markup language used for representing and exchanging structured data between different systems and platforms.
   - **Usage**: Markup languages are used in various applications and contexts, including web development, document processing, data interchange, and content management.

2. **Plain Text**:
   - **Definition**: Plain text refers to unformatted text that consists of characters from a standard character encoding, such as ASCII or Unicode. It does not contain any markup or formatting instructions.
   - **Purpose**: Plain text is used to represent raw textual content without any structural or formatting elements. It is often used for storing and exchanging textual data in its simplest form, without any additional markup or styling.
   - **Examples**: Plain text documents include text files (.txt) created with text editors, command-line output, email messages, source code files, and more.
   - **Usage**: Plain text is widely used for various purposes, including writing documents, coding, scripting, logging, communication, and data storage. It is easily readable and editable by both humans and computers.

In summary, the main difference between markup language and plain text lies in their representation of information: markup languages use tags or markers to define structure and formatting, while plain text consists of unformatted text without any markup or styling. Markup languages provide a structured approach to organizing and presenting content, while plain text offers a simple, unadorned representation of textual data.</li>
<li>Markup language and text are related concepts but serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics:

1. **Markup Language**:
   - Markup language is a system for annotating documents with tags or markers to define their structure and formatting.
   - Markup languages are used to describe the structure, layout, and presentation of documents, enabling the separation of content from presentation.
   - Markup languages use special characters or symbols, called markup tags or elements, to indicate the structure and formatting of the document.
   - Examples of markup languages include HTML (HyperText Markup Language), XML (eXtensible Markup Language), Markdown, and LaTeX.

2. **Text**:
   - Text refers to a sequence of characters, symbols, or words that convey meaning and information.
   - Text can exist in various forms, including plain text, formatted text, and structured text.
   - Plain text consists of unformatted characters and does not contain any markup or formatting instructions.
   - Formatted text includes text that has been styled or formatted using formatting options such as font size, font style, color, alignment, and indentation.
   - Structured text may include elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and hyperlinks, but these elements are not encoded using markup tags as in markup languages.

In summary, while both markup language and text involve the representation of information, markup language is a system for annotating documents with tags or markers to define their structure and formatting, whereas text refers to the actual content of the document, which may or may not include formatting or structure. Markup languages are used to describe the structure and presentation of text, while text itself is the raw material that is structured and formatted using markup languages or other means.</li>
<li>Markup language and text are two distinct concepts used in document creation and communication, but they serve different purposes and have different characteristics. Here's a differentiation between the two:

1. **Markup Language**:
