    KeyWord:-
        -> This are the pre-defined words whose meaning will known to JS engine.
        -> all keywords are written in lowercase
        -> Ex:- if , else , continue ,break etc.
        -> In JS mainly considered with 3 declaration keywords to store the data in variable that is var,let & const.
            var     - basic keyword using from version ES-1
            let & const - keyword using from version ES-6

    var Keyword:-
        -> In var keyword all cases are possible -> (declaration,Initialization,re-Initialization & re-declaration)

        ex:-
                var a ; //declaration
                a = 10; // Initialization
                console.log(a);

                a = 'Hai'  // re-Initialization
             
                console.log(a);

                var a; //re-declaration
          
                console.log(a);
    let Keyword:-
        -> In  let keyword 3 cases are possible -> ( declaration,Initialization,re-Initialization)
        -> re-declaration is not possible in let keyword.
        
        ex:-
                let b ; //declaration
                b = 20; //Initialization
                console.log(b);

                b = 'BAI';// re-initialization
                console.log(b);

                //let b ; // re-declaration not possible in let case.
                b = false;
                console.log(b);
    
    const Keyword:-
        ->  In const keyword declaration & Initialization is possible but in same line (Ex :- const c = "hai")
        ->  Both reinitialization and redeclaration are not possible in const keytword.

        ex:-
                //const c; // declaration and initialization not done in one line
                //c =234;

                const d1 = 43;

                // d1=45;//Assignment to constant variable. , reassignatino not work with const
                
                console.log(d1);

                // const d1 = 90; //Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'd1' has already been declared  , redeclaration not allowed
