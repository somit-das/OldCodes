                    Mixmi frozen yogurt is made in a facility where ice cream products containing pecans, walnuts, and peanuts could be packaged on the same line that packages Mixmi Frozen Yogurt. The facility operates using a preventative control program as required by the US Food and Drug Administration. Allergen control is a major component of this program.
