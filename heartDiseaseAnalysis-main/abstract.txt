The main purpose of designing this system is to predict the risk of heart disease in a patient and trying to. we have used Various Machine Learning algorithms to evaluate and train the model, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The main objective of this project is not just predicting the risk of a heart attack but also analysing and putting some results which might help us to determine the risk factors based on the patientâ€™s vital signs and to extract some insights which helps us to understand their working principle.
